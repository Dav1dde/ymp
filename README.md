This media player currently supports Youtube playlists and
exports a [MPRIS2](http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/) interface to control it.

Recommended gnome plugin:
* https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/

Future features:
* Webinterface
* m3u/pls playlists
* multiple backends (probably)
* multiple mainloops (maybe)
